    <h2>It's nice to meet you, I'm Lola Heffernan.</h2>
    <p>Towards the end of my pre-med Bachelor's program, I was faced with a sizable list of possible career paths. After careful deliberation, I chose "none of the above" and set out to become a software engineer - something I had never envisioned or considered for myself. I have since spent over a year studying full stack web development and computer science, on my own and as a student at Lambda School.</p>
    <p>I am currently seeking a role as a software engineer on an inclusive and digitally ethical team. If you're hiring or would otherwise like to chat, I'd love to hear from you: 310.386.8394 / lolahef@gmail.com</p>
